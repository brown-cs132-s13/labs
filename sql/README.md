SQL
====

Structured Query Language is a language to speak to databases.

A database is a collection of tables. Each table has a number of columns (or fields)
and rows. Rows usually represent a thing, and columns are one aspect of that thing.
For example, we might have a table of "people" with columns for first name, last name,
and age.

# Your task

In this lab you will be implementing the Zipcoder, a website which tells you where
a zipcode is. Zipcodes for the unfamiliar are 5 digit numbers which specify a region
in the United States (a town, a part of a city, etc.). For example:

02912: Brown University (Providence, RI)

10001: [A sliver of Manhattan](http://goo.gl/maps/7H8Nh)

20500: The White House

02906: Region around Brown in Providence
