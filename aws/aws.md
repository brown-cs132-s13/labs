# CS132 Lab Four: AWS

## AWS
Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is a suite of cloud services provided by Amazon. AWS provide tools for computing, storage, databases, management and more. The services are designed to be massively scalable, so they work well for small projects but can support huge sites as well. In CS132 we will be using EC2 to run our server and S3 to serve static content.

## *Disclaimer*
> While Amazon offers a free tier of some of the AWS services as a trial, most usages incur some cost. Amazon has been generous enought to provide a $100 grant for you to use this semester. This should be ample to cover any reasonable usage of AWS during the course, but please be cautious! As this grant is to you personally, *you* will be responsible for any additional charges, and not Brown CS. Monitor your usage and you should be fine.

## Setting up AWS
Go to [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com "Amazon Web Services") and click the **Sign Up** button in the header. Either login with your existing Amazon account if you have one, or create a new one.

### AWS Console
Take a look at the AWS [console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home "AWS console"). From the homepage the console can be reached by clicking **My Account/Console > AWS Management Console** in the header. Take a second to check out some of the other services offered.
