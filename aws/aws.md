# CS132 Lab Four: AWS

## AWS
Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is a suite of cloud services provided by Amazon. AWS provide tools for computing, storage, databases, management and more. The services are designed to be massively scalable, so they work well for small projects but can support huge sites as well. In CS132 we will be using EC2 to run our server and S3 to serve static content.

## *Disclaimer*
> While Amazon offers a free tier of some of the AWS services as a trial, most
> usages incur some cost. Amazon has been generous enought to provide a $100
> grant for you to use this semester. This should be ample to cover any
> reasonable usage of AWS during the course, but please be cautious! As this
> grant is to you personally, *you* will be responsible for any additional
> charges, and not Brown CS. Monitor your usage and you should be fine. We
> recommend you set up alerts to warn you about your usage.
